# What is this?

This is a course i am taking "on my own accord" from Pluralsight. This merely functions as a connection between Pluralsight and the work i am doing on my local PC. Below you'll find the course description.

## Build a Banking Portal with Node & Express

In this project youâ€™ll build a simple Banking Portal with Node & Express. There will be seven different routes that will include index, profile, savings, checking, credit, transfer and payment. We'll provide you with some starter code that includes several view templates. You'll use Node's built-in `fs` library to read and write data. We will also use the Express router to make the application more modular.
